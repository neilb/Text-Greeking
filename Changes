Revision history for Perl module Text::Greeking

    - I hadn't noticed that t/01_compile.t was expecting min perl 5.0061,

    - Added SEE ALSO link to Acme::CorpusScrambler
    - Tidied up the SYNOPSIS
    - Added Text::Lorem, Text::Lorem::More, Lingua::ManagementSpeak,
      and Faker to SEE ALSO.
